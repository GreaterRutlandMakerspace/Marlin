# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware

## MintyPrinter Edition

This is a modification of the base Marlin firmware for the large 3D printer.
It is probably useless to you unless you have an old InDimension Glacier Summit printer that has been heavily customized and upgraded.

Configs and notes refer to this specific printer.
